This example shows how to create a macro that calls `this.bar` when the type of `this` is not known but otherwise the name and parameters of the target method are known. The tricky part is to obtain the reference of `this`. We can do it by inspecting the place where the macro is expanded. We can obtain the symbol of the method where it is expanded via `Symbol.spliceOwner`. We can then access the symbol of the place where that method is defined (a class or another method in case of method nesting) via `Symbol.owner`.
